Imagine you're on a train, and you throw a ball straight up. To you, it looks like it goes straight up and down. But to someone standing on the platform, it looks like the ball is moving in a curve because the train is moving really fast. That's kind of like how time and space work. The faster you move, the slower time goes, and the more space gets all curvy and weird.\""
